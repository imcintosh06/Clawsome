            <p class="info-cat">A domestic house cat is the only domesticed species of small carnivorous mammal of the Felidae
                 family, which also includes tigers, lions, and leopards.
                House cats are widely kept as household pets but they can also be free range such as farm cats or they may become
                 feral due to a lack of human contact over an extended period of time. They are an extremely popular pet amoung
                  U.S. citizens but are second for the favortie amoung households, being beat out by dogs (65.1 million adopted
                   dogs vs 46.5 million adopted cats).<p>

             the smallest cat breed in the world is the Singapura which is only 6-8 inches long and weighs between 4-8 pounds on
              average. All this to say that there are many varieties to cats and many more to choose from!</p>

    <h2 class="cat-s">How Good Are Their Senses?</h2>

    <div class="hearing">
        <img src="./Catearsfeatured.jpg" class="ears" alt="cat ears">
        <p class="hearing-e">Cats have incredible hearing thanks to them having 32 muscles in their outer ears compared to humans!
             Cats can hear at frequencies far greater than a human. A human with normal hearing can hear between 64 and 26,000 Hz
              (hertz) while a cat can hear between 48 and 85,000 Hz! They can also hear 4-5 times farther away than humans.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="eye-sight">
        <img src="./Cat_Eyes_Blog.jpg" class="eyeball" alt="eyes">
        <p class="eyes">A cats eyesight is fantastic, though worse than a humans in some ways. One good thing about their eyesight
             is that they are very sensitive to movement.
            They can detect moving objects at speeds of up to 4 milimeters per second, making them excellent hunters.
             They also have a wider field of periphreal vision than we do. They can see 200 degrees while humans can only see 180.
              However, cats are mid-sighted. They have a hard time seeing things that are very close to them or very far away, their
               sweet spot is about 100-200 feet away. They're also red and green colorblind, but they're really good at seeing shades
                of blue and yellow.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="smell">
        <img src="Catnose.jpg" class="bignose" alt="nosey">
        <p class="cat-nose">A cats nose is the primary way it identifies obvjects and people. They have over 200 million
             odor sensors in their noses compared to humans who have only 5 milion.
             Their sense of smell is 14 times great than a humans. Their sense of smell is so sensitive that it's better
              to not use any scented litters or allow any unfamiliar smells into their environment, it make upset the cat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="taste">
        <img src="./cattongue.jpg" class="pink" alt="lick">
        <p class="cat-tongue"> Cats have a weak sense of taste with only a measly 473 taste buds in thier mouths, compared
             to humans who have 9,000. This, however, does not mean they taste less than humans, it just means that their
             perception of taste is different than ours, such as the fact that cats can't taste anything sweet but can
              distinguish everything else.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="touch">
        <img src="./noses.jpg" class="boop" alt="cutecats">
        <p class="cat-touch"> Touch is the primary source of affection for cats. Cats will groom, and lay with eachother from a
             very young age. The more contact you have with a cat the more likely it will enjoy human contact, however, cats very
              how much they like being pet or held so try not to go all out with touching your cat or they might surpise you with
               a scratch to you hand. A cats whiskers act as an extension to their skin. They detect the smallest changes in the
                environment, air currents, temperature, air pressure, and wind direction. Whiskers are embedded 3 times as deep as
                 their fur and translate the slightest contact to sensory cells at their roots.</p>

<section class="Babies">
<h2 class="catbaby">Reproduction?</h2>

<div class="repo">
    <img src="./cat-nursing-kittens.jpg" class="nursing" alt="cat nursing kittens">
    <p class="cycle">Just like dogs, cats have an estrous cycle, or a heat cycle as it's better known as. However, female cats, also known as queens, are induced ovulators.
         This means females do not ovulate unless they are bred. Being an induced ovulator greatly increases
         the chances of conception which is why stray cats typically have many litters every year. Queens can enter their cycle as young as 4 months old, and will generally
          have 2 or 3 heat cycles during their breeding season (typically between February and October). During her heat,
          a queen will roll, rub against objects, knead her back feet, and yowl repeatedly and often to signal that she is ready to mate.
         These behaviors typically last between 3 to 20 days and can repeat in 10 to 40 days if the queen is not bred. If she is bred, the cycle will end and her body will
          begin to prepare for pregnancy.</p>
       <p class="preg">Pregnancy lasts between 60-63 days (2 months), with the average litter size being 4 kittens.
         Female cats often mate with multiple males during their heat cycle which results in kittens of the same litter having more than one father. Signs of pregancy would
          include an enlarged abdomen, increased appetite, and swollen mammary glands. When the queen is ready to give birth, she will seek a nesting area and will place
           bedding in a quiet and safe spot.</p>

<section class="Wherefrom">
    <h2 class="where">Where Did They Come From?</h2>
    <img src="./sn-catsegypt.jpg" class="egypt" alt="ancient cat art">
    <p class="categypt">It's said that they were around as far back as 9 thousand years ago, but the Felidae family, to which all living feline species belong to, dates
         back as far as 10 to
         11 million years ago. Domesticated cats were predominantly found in the Near-Eastern and Egyptian populations of the world, and born of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wildcat">African Wildcat</a>
          which still actively prowling in Africa, and West and Central Asia.</p>

<section class="Food">
    <h2 class="catfood">What Do They Eat?</h2>
    <img src="./What Human Foods Can Cats EatTEASER.jpg" class="humanfood" alt="hungry cat">
    <p class="hungry">Cats are carniores, meaning they eat meat, so any sort of vegetarian lifestlye simply will not do for a house cat. They mianly eat commercial
         cat food can also eat prefer fish, chicken, eggs, cheese, and sometimes fruits, such as banana, berries
        , apples, and small portions of watermelon and strawberries. House cats have even been seen hunting small birds and rodents from time to time as well and they
         are completely safe for the cat to eat. However, there are some foods that cats should never consume, like cherries, grapes/raisins, citrus fruits like limes
         and grapefruits. The fruits I just listed can cause upset stomachs at best and kidney damage at worst, so it's always best to keep those foods away from a
          curious cat and if you have a garden with any of those fruits in it make sure something is seperating the cat from them.</p>
